What is this?
This is my incredible Online Racing Game. It's a multiplayer game where you try to complete three laps before the other players. I built it with three.js and Firebase.
How do I play?
First, type in your name and use the color slider to choose the color of your car. If you want to be in charge of the game, or you want to play alone, click Host a Game If someone else is hosting the game, press Join a Game When hosting, have all other players type in your four-letter code to join. If someone else is hosting, type in the code on their screen.

If you're on a computer, use the left and right arrow keys to steer. Your car will automatically drive forwards. On a phone, with or without VR mode, tilt your phone to steer.

Be careful not to hit other players!
How does VR mode work?
You need a Google Cardboard or similar headset for this to work. To turn on VR mode, open the settings menu  and click the  button.
Can I make my own tracks?
Yes you can! Just open the settings menu  and click the  button! The editor has instructions inside.
Help! I just went through the wall!
Yeah... That happens sometimes. I'm working on it. Sorry. If you're stuck outside the map, try to drive to the mountains - it sends you back to the startline.
